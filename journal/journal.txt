Week 1

During this week I have been able to use AI in my coursework and job. In my coursework I have been able to use AI to turn my lecture notes into a structured notebook to help me prepare for exams. In my work, I have been able to use AI to help troubleshoot hardware issues, making it easy to support faculty.
