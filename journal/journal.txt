Lastly, for my personal work, I was able to use AI to clearly explain to me troubleshooting instructions to come to a desired solution.

I was also able to use AI to organize specific thoughts and make sure certain answers addressed parts of a question. Overall, AI allowed me to stay productive and understand challenging material.

Week 5

During this week I was able to use AI for a mix of academic and personal work. At my work in the CS Department I was able to use AI to review error messages and find clear explanations for why my code was not recognized in the terminal when trying to open a project in VS Code. AI walked me through installing and configuring the VS Code command line tool correctly which saved time during my work session. I also used Ai to draft email messages to professionals. It helped me strike the right tone, professional, concise, and appreciative. Overall, it made a huge difference in allowing my thoughts to stay organized, troubleshoot issues, and communicate more effectively.
