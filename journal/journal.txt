Week 1

During this week I have been able to use AI in my coursework and job. In my coursework I have been able to use AI to turn my lecture notes into a structured notebook to help me prepare for exams. In my work, I have been able to use AI to help troubleshoot hardware issues, making it easy to support faculty. 

Week 2

During this week I used AI for a mix of classwork, resume review, and personal work. For coursework, I asked AI to help with understanding my lecture notes from history on the Oregon Trail and the Gilded Age. I also used AI to expand certain bullets in my resume to highlight measurable results. Lastly, for my personal work, I was able to use AI to clearly explain to me troubleshooting instructions to come to a desired solution.
